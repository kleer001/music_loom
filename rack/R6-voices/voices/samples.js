/* The recordings, in the two forms they come in.
 *
 * A sustained note is *looped*: one recording covers a whole breath, because
 * the loop points let it run as long as the player blows. A struck one is not
 * -- a frame drum hit is over when it is over -- and what makes a struck
 * sample sound played rather than triggered is having several recordings of
 * the same stroke and not reaching for the same one twice running.
 *
 * So there are two pools here, and they differ in what indexes them.
 * `SampleSet` is indexed by *pitch*: hand it a MIDI note and it finds the
 * nearest recording and the cents to reach it. `StrokeSet` is indexed by
 * *stroke and force*: hand it "hit" at velocity 96 and it finds the layer
 * recorded at about that force, then picks a variation that is not the one it
 * picked last.
 *
 * Neither knows where its files came from. VCSL's own names are irregular --
 * HDrumL_Hit_v2_rr1_Sum, Mid_ShakerDouble_Down_rr1, Cabasa1_Rub_v1_rr2_Mid --
 * so which file is which stroke is decided once, in the build step, and
 * written into the manifest. Nothing at runtime parses a recording's name.

   * are level differences that were never meant to carry meaning.
   *
   * Across layers: VCSL recorded the frame drum at two forces about 15 dB
   * apart in body level, and `pick` crosses between them at the middle of the
   * velocity range, so velocity 63 and velocity 65 differed by 15 dB.
   *
   * Within a layer: the two round-robin takes of one stroke differ by up to
   * 5.4 dB, which is larger than a whole step of the velocity curve. Two
   * strikes at the *same* velocity would land 5 dB apart, and a sweep came out
   * non-monotone -- measurably, velocity 32 sounded quieter than velocity 24.

   * Neither is dynamics. Dynamics are supplied continuously by the velocity
   * curve the caller applies. What a layer is worth is its *timbre* -- a hard
   * strike is brighter and rings longer -- and what a round robin is worth is
   * that no two onsets are identical. Both survive levelling untouched;
   * only the accident of how loud the take happened to be does not.
   *
   * Levelling is within a stroke, never across strokes. A muted hit really is
   * quieter than an open one, and flattening that would erase the difference
   * between two strokes rather than between two takes of one.
   *
   * The reference is the loudest recording, so quieter ones are boosted.
   * Measured on the frame drum: the takes being lifted carry 39-43 dB of
   * signal to noise, and a boost moves signal and noise together, so they
