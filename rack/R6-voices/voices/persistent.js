// The sound sources.

// Sparse music exposes everything, so these are built to the genre's stated
// specifications rather than to generic taste:
//
//   kick   — "thumpy and stiff", and the axis everything else shapes around;
//            in Aerial it also carries the low end outright, because the track
//            has no bass instrument.
//   snare  — snappy, NO low end below 250 Hz, pitched up, bit-crushed and
//            downsampled, then high-passed around 150 Hz after processing.
//   stab   — resolution lowered and made jagged; a band-pass whose cutoff is
//            randomised by a low-Hz LFO to kill harshness; the result reads soft
//            because its high end is deliberately weakened.
//
// **Every voice is a persistent graph that is retriggered, never a graph built
// per note.** This is a hard requirement for an engine meant to run without end,
// and it is a measurement rather than a preference. Scheduling a node per hit
// means the graph keeps every node it was ever given — nothing frees a source
// that has finished — so cost per second of audio climbs with length. Playing a
// 4/4 kick at 125 BPM one node per hit, against the persistent oscillator voice:
//
//              30 s     120 s    300 s      (ms of CPU per audio second)
//   persistent 1.15     1.18     1.14       flat
//   per hit    4.99    19.84    40.74       ~36x by five minutes
//
// Chrome measures the same shape (6.9 / 22.0 / 55.5), so this is not an artefact
// of the offline renderer. An endless engine cannot pay it.
//
// The rule is therefore not "never play samples" — it is that a repeating part
// must not be expressed as a stream of events. Where a pattern is fixed, stamp it
// into a bar-length buffer and loop one node over it; see sampleKick below, which
// plays a sampled kick at flat cost. Where a part genuinely varies per hit, it
// needs a persistent graph with its envelope scheduled, like the voices here.
//
// The consequence to respect: one voice cannot overlap itself. At this genre's
// tempo and decay times nothing does — the closest call is the shaker at 16ths
// (120 ms apart, 55 ms decay).
//
// Two voices run a slow seeded walk on their own filter — the stab's band-pass
// (the step that takes the harshness off it) and the pad's cutoff, which is the
// pad's only motion. A render knows how long it is and arms those once.
// A player does not, so each such voice also publishes its walk as a `walks`
// descriptor and `armVoiceWalks` re-arms it in spans. Without that the walks are
// only as long as whatever `seconds` they were built with, and the instrument
// quietly stops moving when it runs out.
