/* Keys and scales: which pitches a mode offers, in any key.
 *
 * A scale is a set of semitone offsets from the tonic, and a key is a pitch
 * class. Everything else follows by arithmetic -- there is no per-note table to
 * author and nothing to keep in sync with a sample set.
 *
 * The generator downstream works on *positions* in a note list, not on
 * pitches, so changing key or mode means handing it a different list. That is
 * the whole mechanism: the melody engine never learns what a mode is.
