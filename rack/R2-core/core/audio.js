// actually are rather than on a filename. Four callers need it — the renderer,
// the noise corpus, the kick scanner and the live desk — and they should not
// each be guessing from an extension.
//
// The desk uses this rather than ctx.decodeAudioData for two reasons: browser
// support for AIFF is not something to rely on, and decoding the same way in
// both engines means a kick sounds identical on the desk and in the bounce.
