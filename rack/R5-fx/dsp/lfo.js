// Source: dub_synth/engine/dsp/lfo.js
// The LFO tool.
//
// Its vocabulary is what makes it worth having:
// four shapes, tempo-synced divisions from four measures down to a 1/16, a
// deterministic roll from a seed, and **meta-modulation** — an LFO that re-rates
// or re-depths another LFO, which is what stops a modulation bed from settling
// into a pattern you can hear.
//
// One thing had to change in the port. GLITCHFIELD evaluates its LFOs per frame
// in a requestAnimationFrame loop and writes the result to AudioParams, which
// cannot render offline — there are no frames in an OfflineAudioContext. So here
// an LFO is either a **native OscillatorNode** (sine, triangle and square are all
// native types, sample-accurate and free) or, for the random shape, a **scheduled
// walk** onto the param. Both render offline and both stay inside the seeded
// contract.
//
// Two rate systems, deliberately: `div` is tempo-synced in beats, `hz` is free.
// Dub needs both — Koçer's echo modulation is explicitly non-synchronised because
// that is what reads as a hand, while a filter that breathes with the bar reads as
// arrangement.
