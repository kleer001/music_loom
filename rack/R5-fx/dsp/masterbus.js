//
// Shaped after a master chain of pre → anti-mud EQ → limiter → master gain →
// tanh clip. Two rules drive everything here:
//
//   "Mastering = glue, not a brickwall."  A tanh master at SAT 0.6 keeps a
//   healthy crest; SAT 2.0 slams it to ~5 dB and ships hot on every take.
//   "Kick owns the sub; the bass sits above it."
//
// **There is deliberately no DynamicsCompressor in this chain.** Under
// node-web-audio-api it does not limit — it inflates the output to roughly a
// constant level regardless of input, so a graph that leans on it measures as a
// lie offline and behaves differently in a browser. Everything here is a biquad,
// a gain, or a waveshaper, all of which render identically both ways. The
// dynamics that need real detection happen at bounce time in master.js, where
// they can be computed exactly.
//
// Chain: input → anti-mud dip → tilt shelves → trim → tanh clip → output
