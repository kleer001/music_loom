// Pure DSP over Float32Array channels: no audio context, no nodes, no library.
// That is the point. node-web-audio-api's DynamicsCompressor does not limit —
// it inflates the output to roughly a constant level whatever goes in — so any
// dynamics stage built from it measures as a lie offline and behaves differently
// in a browser. Computing the gain reduction here instead makes the result exact,
// identical every run, and testable without rendering anything.
//
// The targets:
//   true-peak   ≤ -1 dBFS        (inter-sample clipping)
//   clipped     0 samples
//   crest       ≥ 9 dB, healthy 9-13   — the "too hot" detector
//   "Mastering = glue, not a brickwall."
//
// So the defaults here are gentle: a slow bus compressor doing a couple of dB,
// then a look-ahead limiter that only catches what is left. If the limiter is
// working hard, the mix upstream is wrong — `report()` says so out loud rather
// than quietly squashing it.
