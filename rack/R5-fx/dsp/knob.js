// Dub's motion comes from a person moving parameters during the mix, not from
// notes changing (research/dub_techno_technique.md §3, §4). Koçer reproduces
// that hand with an LFO set to a **random waveshape at a non-synchronised
// rate** — explicitly not sine or square, because predictability is what the
// gesture is meant to defeat (§2).
//
// Web Audio has no random-waveshape LFO node, and an AudioWorklet would break
// the offline-render requirement. So the walk is *scheduled* onto the
// AudioParam ahead of time. That also keeps it inside core/rng.js's seeded
// contract: same seed → same performance → reproducible renders.

// §2's three hand-rates, in one place because three callers need the same ones
// and a diagnostic that measures different rates than the render is worse than
// no diagnostic.
//
// The feedback figure is 4.26 Hz, a knob position measured off one Ableton
// session, and §2 is emphatic that it is NOT synchronised: it sits at a ratio
// near 39 against the tone drift so the combined motion never repeats. Held as a
// bare constant that intent survives at exactly one tempo — at 125 BPM 4.26 Hz
// is an eighth note 2.2% sharp, slipping a whole cycle every ~5.6 bars, which is
// what a hand riding in time with a track does; at 144 it is 11% flat of an
// eighth and means something else. So it is anchored to the eighth and detuned
// off it, and the detune stays an awkward fraction on purpose: a round one would
// periodically relock the two LFOs and cost exactly the property §2 asks for.
//
// The drift stays absolute. Its 9.1-second period is below the band where tempo
// means anything — it is heard as breathing, not as placement — and pinning it to
// the grid would only risk making it commensurable with the walk.
//
// The warp is the one LFO §2 beat-syncs, and §2 names its rate: a 1/4.
