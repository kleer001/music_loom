// The riddim model makes the sound-system operator a "macro-composer": someone
// who composes by deconstructing and reconstructing a finished whole in
// performance, with every instrument track individually manipulable through
// processors and faders. Structure in the
// analysed records is made almost entirely of mixer gestures — muting the kick
// makes the break, muting the shaker makes the dip, muting the ride starts the
// descent. So the mixer is not plumbing here; it is where the composition
// happens.
//
// Buses are named and arbitrary in number on purpose. Resonance's three stab
// layers each need their own echo, because the piece's four-bar call-and-
// response is produced by their *decays intersecting* — one shared echo bus
// cannot make that sound.
